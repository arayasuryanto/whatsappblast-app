## ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUE: Railway Deployment

### **Problem:**
Railway shows "Application failed to respond" despite multiple deployment attempts

### **Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
1. ✅ Updated to Node.js 20 (required by dependencies)
2. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
3. ✅ Implemented lazy loading for WhatsApp
4. ✅ Added memory optimization (--max_old_space_size=512)
5. ✅ Created minimal server without heavy dependencies
6. ✅ Created ultra minimal test server with ZERO dependencies

### **Current Status:**
**Ultra minimal test server deployed** - uses only Node.js built-in modules
- No npm dependencies
- No build process
- Pure Node.js http server
- Comprehensive logging

**This will determine:** If Railway can run basic Node.js apps or if there's a configuration issue
